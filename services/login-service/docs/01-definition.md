## Service API

### Synchronous APIs

| API Operation  | Events Published   |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| createEntity() | EntityCreatedEvent |
| deleteEntity() | EntityDeletedEvent |
| getEntity()    | NA                 |

## Non-functional Requirements

* Availability: xx.xx% availability. For example, 99.95% availability
* Throughput: x y/second. For example, 1000 transactions/second
* Performance: x ms per each y operation invocation. For example, 500 ms to create a customer  

## Observability
