# Mybank Code Review Process

I shamelessly stole this from a [great article](https://phauer.com/2018/code-review-guidelines/) by Philip Hauer. Please refer to the original article for details. 

## Code review rules for Authors

- [ ] Be humble

- [ ] You are not your code

- [ ] You are on the same side

- [ ] Mind the IKEA effect

  > The IKEA effect is a cognitive bias in which consumers place a disproportionately high value on products they partially created

- [ ] New perspective on your code

- [ ] Exchange of best practices and experiences

## Code review rules for Reviewers

- [ ] Use I messages
- [ ] Talk about the code, not the coder
- [ ] Ask questions and clarifications
- [ ] Refer to author's behavior, not their traits
- [ ] Accept there are different solutions
- [ ] Don't criticize every line of code
- [ ] Praise
